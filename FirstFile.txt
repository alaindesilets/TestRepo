In 'branch1', I completely replace content of this file with new content.

Then, after maintainers feedback, I add this line in 'branch1'.

While branch1 is still in the oven, I start a second branch 'branch2' which creates this lie of text.

And then, I add this line based on maintainer feedback on 'branch2'.
